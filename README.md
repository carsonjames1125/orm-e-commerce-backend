# ORM E-Commerce Back-End Application

## Description

The motivation for this project came from wanting to keep track of ecommerce merchadise and data. Building this project came from wanted to give items id and foreign keys to be able to update and keep track of them using mysqls database and table. This solves problems keeping track of inventory for many places that sell ecommerce. I learned how to use mysql more indepth, sequelize, and how to link multiple js files that build upon each other.
